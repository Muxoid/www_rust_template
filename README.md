# Rust Actix-Web + PostgreSQL CRUD Application

This project serves as a robust springboard for developing database-driven CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications using Rust with Actix-Web framework and PostgreSQL. It leverages SQLx for safe, compile-time checked SQL queries and migrations, ensuring a smooth development experience with Rust's strong type system. The project includes basic authentication mechanisms, making it an ideal starting point for building secure web applications.

## Features

- **Actix-Web Framework**: Utilizes the powerful and flexible Actix-Web framework for handling HTTP requests in a performant manner.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Leverages PostgreSQL for its advanced features and reliability as a database.
- **SQLx for Migrations**: Uses SQLx for compile-time checked SQL queries and database migrations, enhancing safety and development productivity.
- **Basic Authentication**: Implements basic authentication to secure access to certain endpoints within the application.
- **CRUD Operations**: Ready-to-use examples of Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations against the PostgreSQL database.
